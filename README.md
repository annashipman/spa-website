# SPA website

This is the jekyll project for programme chairs to produce most of the pages associated with the [http://spaconference.org](SPA conference) website.

There are some pages that cannot be edited from here:

 - The programme. This is worked on by the organisers privately and published via a different route when ready.
 - Previous conferences, which are left in situ once the year changes. There is a backup of them in the [SPA conference organisation](https://github.com/spaconference/previous-spa-sites).
 - Scripts under MySpa. The PHP functionality of the site is in another (currently private) repo.

To run locally: `bundle exec jekyll serve`. The output of that command will tell you where the site is running locally (something like `localhost:4000/$conference_year/`).
