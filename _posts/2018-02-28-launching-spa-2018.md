Every year, SPA conference unites forward-thinking practitioners with a diverse range of speakers and facilitators. The goal of SPA is to find new and better ways to advance software development; the philosophy is to combine old with new. New topics that challenge us to look at software development in a different way, and new voices to envigorate the community with new ideas.

For 2018, we are delighted to announce two of our keynotes: Jon Skeet and Chris O'Dell. Jon is the leading scorer on StackOverflow.com and Chris is a Continuous Delivery expert and co-author of multiple leading CD books. It's a special line up, and we look forward to making further announcements soon.
