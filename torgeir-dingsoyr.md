## Agile Development in Large-Scale: Challenges and Insight from Research

Agile methods were aimed at small, co-located teams developing non-critical software products. The success of these methods for small teams have led to use in projects with tens of teams and hundreds of developers. Are agile methods suited in this new context? What fundamental assumptions in agile methods become challenging with scale? What can we learn from prior studies on key areas such as managing uncertainty, coordination, sharing knowledge, self management and tailoring of development method?
