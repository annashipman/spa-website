<h1>About the Conference</h1>
<p>The annual BCS Software Practice Advancement conference brings together experts and practitioners to share the latest thinking in software development.</p>
<p>Now in its 22nd year, our conference has a tradition of active participation. We encourage conference sessions that bring people together to work and learn and in most cases, many sessions are highly interactive, involving participants and session leaders on an equal footing. This results in a conference like no other and consistently excellent feedback from all those who attend.</p>
