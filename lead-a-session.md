{{ site.conference.name }} is about practitioners sharing experiences from any aspect of software development - technology, people and process - sharing their thoughts and knowledge, and learning together. It is about building a community of attendees that can learn and share new, interesting and thought provoking experiences from the broadest spectrum of their profession.

## Sessions 

Sessions are 75 minutes, or 150 minutes with a break in the middle

All the sessions are interactive. We believe in the power of physically doing, be it through practice, thoughtful evaluation, discussion or games. In this way everyone can be an active participant and learn by doing. It helps give {{ site.conference.name }} it's particular vibe.


## What topics are we looking for?

We welcome a wide variety of perspectives on all aspects of software development - new ideas, old ideas rediscovered, creativity, the unexpected, reflection and fun. In the past we’ve had sessions on programming languages, tools, techniques, design, architecture, testing, coaching, team dynamics, pairing and organising a team’s work.

We’ve also had some great sessions on topics you might not expect at a software conference, like sketching, speed reading, and education. We really like sessions like this too - they give us more opportunities to think about and try out a wide range of things.

At {{ site.conference.name }} you can experiment and try something new, or bring a session you’ve perfected elsewhere - we value both. All submissions get feedback to help them improve, and accepted sessions will be assigned a shepherd to help with preparation so we’ll support you along the way.

You can get an idea of the sort of sessions that have run previously from the [sample of some of the past sessions](successful-sessions.html) from the last four years' conferences. We have selected them to give you some indication of the range of topics and how the application form has been completed by others.

But don't be constrained by any of these ideas; maybe you've got something totally new to share. We'd like to hear it.

We’d love to see in your proposal how you’ll make your session interactive and get participants involved. You can get some ideas of ways to do that from our page of suggestions for [improving interactivity](interactivity.html) or propose anything else you like.

## Who do we want to hear from?

Anyone involved in the process of developing software, whatever your role - product manager, artist, developer, musician, business analyst, designer...

We particularly encourage speakers who are new to presenting at {{ site.conference.name }}. If you submit early, our feedback process will allow you to tune your proposal before the final review stage.

## The submission and selection process
