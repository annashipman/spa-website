Every year, SPA conference unites forward-thinking practitioners with a diverse range of speakers and facilitators. The goal of SPA is to find new and better ways to advance software development; the philosophy is to combine old with new. New topics that challenge us to look at software development in a different way, and new voices to invigorate the community with new ideas.

For 2018, we are delighted to announce two of our keynotes: Jon Skeet and Chris O'Dell. Jon is the leading scorer on StackOverflow.com and Chris is a Continuous Delivery expert and co-author of multiple leading CD books. It's a special line up, and we look forward to making further announcements soon.

    Jon is a Staff Software Engineer at Google, working in London to make Google Cloud Platform rock for C# developers. When he's not doing that, he enjoys stretching the rules of C# to breaking point, making date and time fun (or at least plausible) to work with in .NET, and posting on Stack Overflow.

She currently works at Contino helping clients to understand, adopt, and sustain good practices for building and operating software systems.  She has led teams delivering highly available Web APIs, distributed systems and cloud based services.

When the schedule is announced, expect to see a variety of topics.
