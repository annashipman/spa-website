<h1>About the Conference</h1>

All participants at the event are required to follow the SPA code of conduct.
<!-- <p>The annual BCS SPA Software in Practice conference brings together experts and practitioners to share the latest thinking in software development.</p>
<p>Now in its 26th year, our conference has a tradition of active participation. We intend to continue this tradition in an entirely online format this year.</p> 
<p>We encourage conference sessions that bring people together to work and learn and most sessions are highly interactive, involving participants and session leaders on an equal footing. This results in a conference like no other and consistently excellent feedback from all those who attend.</p>-->
