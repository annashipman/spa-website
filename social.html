<h2>Monday evening diversions</h2>
<p>Beer Tasting and talk from James Atherton from <a href="http://www.beerblefish.co.uk/" target="_blank">The Beerblefish Brewing Company.</a></p>

<h2>Tuesday evening diversions</h2>
<p>"The Unbelievable Knuth". A panel show based on "The Unbelievable Truth" radio show, in which each panelist prepares a short talk on a subject of their choice. The talk should be entirely untruthful, except for 5 statements of truth. The panelist delivers the talk while the other panelists interrupt if they think they have spotted a truth. If they are correct they win a point, otherwise they loose a point, and any undetected truths score for the presenter.</p>
