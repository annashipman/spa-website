## Sustaining Remote-First Teams

Curious about how to build and sustain a ‘remote-first’ culture? At Tes we have more engineers working from home or travelling than sitting at a desk in our London office. Over the last few years we adapted our engineering practices to support small teams working in close collaboration over distance. Part of what sustains this way of working is the way we organise hack days and engineering weeks and other cross-team initiatives.
