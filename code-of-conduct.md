All participants at our events are required to agree with the following code of conduct to help us achieve a safe and positive event experience for everyone.

Unacceptable behaviour includes intimidating, harassing, abusive, discriminatory, derogatory or demeaning conduct by any participant at our events or online communities including Twitter and other online media.

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, race religion, disability, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact and unwelcome sexual attention.

If a participant engages in behaviour that violates this code of conduct, the event organisers will take the appropriate action, including warning or expulsion from the conference with no refund.

If participants have any concerns, please inform a member of the [organising committee]({{ '/organisers.html' | relative_url }}) or a member of BCS staff who will offer support in contacting the appropriate security and ensure required assistance is given.
