## [![Ministry of Justice][moj-logo]{: width="300" height="300" }][moj-blog]

[MOJ Digital & Technology][moj-blog] design, build and support
user-centred digital and technology services for the justice system:
services that make a real difference to our staff, members of the
public and their families who use them. Millions of people every year
interact with our services, and Digital & Technology play an important
role in improving access to justice and making that experience much
easier and less distressing.

We are using digital, data and technology to build capability, work
smarter and more efficiently. We want to create a digitally enabled
end-to-end justice system which can adapt and respond to changing
needs. We also make sure our 74,000 staff have the tools and technology
they need to keep tribunals, courts and prisons operating effectively.
